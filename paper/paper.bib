abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

@article{Austin2011,
abstract = {Statistical species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict the potential changes in species distributions under climate change scenarios. We suggest that we need to revisit the conceptual framework and ecological assumptions on which the relationship between species distributions and environment is based. We present a simple conceptual framework to examine the selection of environmental predictors and data resolution scales. These vary widely in recent papers, with light inconsistently included in the models. Focusing on light as a necessary component of plant SDMs, we briefly review its dependence on aspect and slope and existing knowledge of its influence on plant distribution. Differences in light regimes between north- and south-facing aspects in temperate latitudes can produce differences in temperature equivalent to moves 200 km polewards. Local topography may create refugia that are not recognized in many climate change SDMs using coarse-scale data. We argue that current assumptions about the selection of predictors and data resolution need further testing. Application of these ideas can clarify many issues of scale, extent and choice of predictors, and potentially improve the use of SDMs for climate change modelling of biodiversity.},

@article{Guisan2013,
abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

@article{Descombes2016,
abstract = {Monitoring and species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to support conservation planning but are rarely projected at a very high resolution for conservation management. In this study, we compared the population distribution and size of five invasive plant species along an 18 km alluvial system in Switzerland, over a period of 11 years. Exhaustive inventories of past (2001) to current (2012) populations showed a massive increase in invaded areas over the eleven years. Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica were the species with the largest increases in population number and size. The ecological preferences of each species were then modelled at 1 m resolution, using environmental variables expressing topography, disturbances, dispersal, soil texture and light availability. SDMs successfully depicted the niches at very high resolution. Some of the important predictors (e.g., canopy density, distance to river) would have been unhelpful at a coarser resolution. From these very-high-resolution models, we predicted the potential distribution and abundance of species and derived two indices indicating the amount of habitat still available for future species colonisation, crucial information for management. Large, empty areas were predicted to be suitable for each species, suggesting that the observed increase in population size may continue in the future. The two proposed range-filling indices and abundance models may be used efficiently in future studies at very fine resolution to prioritise eradication efforts in previously invaded areas and controls in areas at high risk of invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficiency of SDMs to predict invasions at such a fine resolution.},
